Life gets busy — and if you've visited this site before, you've probably noticed it has been sitting untouched for a while. Well, I finally carved out some time in what has been a very full schedule to give it the refresh it deserved.

It felt like the right moment to update things, because honestly, a lot has changed since this site was last touched.

## Nine Years and Counting

Back in 2017 I stepped into a marketing role, and what started as one thing has grown into so much more. Over the years I've developed skills across a pretty wide range of areas — management, product development, e-commerce, social media marketing, and more than I could fit into a single list. Each year has brought new challenges and new things to figure out, and I've genuinely enjoyed the process.

It hasn't always been straightforward, but that's kind of the point. The roles that stretch you are the ones that teach you the most, and I feel like I'm still very much in that mode — learning, adapting, and trying to make a real impact in what I do.

## What's Next

I'm looking forward to continuing to grow in my career, taking on new challenges, and sharing more of what I'm working on here. I also have some other things in the works — more on that soon.

For now, it just feels good to have a corner of the internet that actually reflects where I'm at. Thanks for stopping by.
