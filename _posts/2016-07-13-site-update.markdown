Just a quick update on the site today, updated the about me page, and a few other suttle things.

I have a few things I would like to do including:

* Adding pages
  * A dedicated homepage (/)
  * blog (/blog just build a page ext for it move the page from the homepage or /)
  * music (page dedicated to music I produce, updates etc.)
  * about (fix page up)
  * code (same as music but just programming portfolio)
* Setting up https
  * also adding PGP key to site for contact (security is always good)
* Site Redesign
  * either Jekyll, or possibly build dynamic site
