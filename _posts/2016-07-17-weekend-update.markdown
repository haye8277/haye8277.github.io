Now on to music, this weekend I listened To the Blank Face LP by Schoolboy Q, I enjoyed the LP overall, although I did feel like there was some filler songs that could have been removed. Suggestion: Stream it. Fav songs are: Ride Out, Groovy Tony_Eddie Kane, Dope Dealer and THat Part (Black Hippy Remix).
