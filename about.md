      <h2>Project Management</h2>
      <p>I have experience managing across multiple departments, keeping complex moving parts aligned and on track. From coordinating cross-functional teams to overseeing product development from concept to delivery, I focus on cutting through the noise and getting things done without losing sight of the bigger picture.</p>

      <h2>Marketing</h2>
      <p>From brand strategy to digital campaigns, I understand how to connect ideas with audiences. I approach marketing analytically — measuring what works, cutting what doesn't, and always focusing on the message that resonates.</p>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>Programming</h2>
      <p>I have a background in computer programming, with hands-on experience developing workarounds and practical fixes in workplace environments. I also studied at the <strong>University of Waterloo</strong>, where I built a solid technical foundation that I continue to draw on today. Check out my work on <a href="https://github.com/haye8277" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <h2>Music Production</h2>
      <p>On the side, I make experimental electronic music under the name <strong>Knee Jar</strong> — mostly dark ambient stuff with a heavy electronic influence. It's a hobby I genuinely love, and lately I've been having a lot of fun experimenting with AI production tools to see where they can take the creative process. Have a listen on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/knee-jar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SoundCloud</a>.</p>

      <h2>AI &amp; Emerging Tech</h2>
      <p>I'm someone who is constantly following the AI space — keeping up with the latest developments, trying out new tools, and always looking for ways to use them to make things more efficient. Whether it's streamlining workflows, speeding up decision-making, or just exploring what's newly possible, I'm always looking for the practical edge AI can provide.</p>
