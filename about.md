    <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="about-cards">

    <div class="about-card">
      <h3>Project Management</h3>
      <p>I've spent a lot of time keeping things from falling apart. Managing across departments, wrangling timelines, making sure product development actually makes it from idea to reality — that's the kind of work I've grown into over the years. I like having a lot of moving parts, honestly. Keeps things interesting.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-card">
      <h3>Marketing</h3>
      <p>Marketing is where I started and it's still what I find most interesting. I care about the message more than the medium — figuring out what actually resonates with people and building from there. I'm not big on fluff or vanity metrics. Just stuff that works.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-card">
      <h3>Programming</h3>
      <p>I studied computer science at the <strong>University of Waterloo</strong> and have been picking things apart ever since. I'm not a full-time developer, but I've built workarounds, written scripts, and patched together solutions at more than a few workplaces. It's handy being able to speak the language when you need to. My stuff is on <a href="https://github.com/haye8277" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> if you want to have a look.</p>

    <div class="about-card">
      <h3>Music Production</h3>
      <p>This one's purely for fun. I make weird electronic music under the name <strong>Knee Jar</strong> — dark, ambient, a little hard to describe. No formal training, no rules, just messing around until something sounds interesting. Lately I've been playing around with some AI production tools which has opened up a few unexpected directions. If you're curious, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/knee-jar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SoundCloud</a> has everything.</p>

    <div class="about-card">
      <h3>AI &amp; Emerging Tech</h3>
      <p>I follow the AI space pretty closely — not in an obsessive way, just genuinely curious about where it's all going. I'm always looking for ways to use new tools to make things a bit more efficient, whether that's at work or in the music studio. The practical applications are what get me excited, less so the hype.</p>
