      <h2>Project Management</h2>
      <p>I bring structure and clarity to complex projects, coordinating teams and resources to deliver results on time. I thrive at the intersection of strategy and execution, keeping things moving while keeping everyone aligned.</p>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>Marketing</h2>
      <p>From brand strategy to digital campaigns, I understand how to connect ideas with audiences. I approach marketing analytically — measuring what works, cutting what doesn't, and always focusing on the message that resonates.</p>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>Programming</h2>
      <p>I build software and enjoy working across the stack. Whether it's a quick automation script or a full web project, I like solving problems with code. Check out my latest work on <a href="https://github.com/haye8277" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>.</p>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>Music Production</h2>
      <p>I produce experimental electronic music under the name <strong>Knee Jar</strong> — dark ambient soundscapes with heavy electronic influence. Entirely self-taught, which has pushed me toward an unconventional and personal sound. Listen on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/knee-jar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SoundCloud</a>.</p>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>AI &amp; Emerging Tech</h2>
      <p>I'm deeply interested in how artificial intelligence is reshaping the way we work, create, and communicate. I follow developments closely, experiment with new tools, and think a lot about where it's all heading.</p>
