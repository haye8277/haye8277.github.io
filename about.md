# About Me

My name is Jacob, I am a Developer and an Experimental Music producer.

Check out my <a href="http://www.kneejar.com">Blog</a> for a look inside of what I am doing or check out my projects to check out my latest work or what is to come.

## Programming

This is site is currently a work in progress, to follow the progress check out the blog or the <a href="https://github.com/haye8277/haye8277.github.io">Github Page</a> for more detailed information.

## Music

All works can be found on my <a href="http://soundcloud.com/knee-jar">Soundcloud Page</a> I aim to produce dark ambient soundscapes, with heavy electronic influence. I have no formal music training so all my techniques are self-taught which has allowed me to create a very interesting fusion of Experimental Electronic sound Art.
